# CSS Inheritance

Inheritance in CSS is the mechanism through which certain properties are passed on from a parent element down to its children. It’s quite similar to inheritance in genetics, really. If the parents have blue eyes, their children will probably have blue eyes, too.

Not all CSS properties are inherited, because it doesn’t make sense for some of them to be. For instance, margins are not inherited, since it’s unlikely that a child element should need the same margins as its parent.
